1.	Pride and Prejudice
Author: Jane Austen
About:  The novel opens with one of the most famous lines in English literature: “It is a truth universally
acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.” The statement
is seemingly what Mrs. Bennet thinks as she sets her sights on the newly arrived Bingley, who she is sure will
make a suitable husband for one of her daughters. At a ball, Bingley takes an immediate interest in the
beautiful and shy Jane. The encounter between his friend Darcy and Elizabeth is less cordial. Although Austen
shows them intrigued by each other, she reverses the convention of first impressions: the pride of rank and
fortune and prejudice against the social inferiority of Elizabeth’s family hold Darcy aloof, while the pride of
self-respect and prejudice against Darcy’s snobbery hold Elizabeth equally aloof.

knowing that it could make the gods deem her unworthy. But with a fallen kingdom on the rise, she not only
