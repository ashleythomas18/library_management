1.	Dune
Author: Frank Herbert
About: Dune is set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses
control planetary fiefs. It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the
planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only
source of melange, or "spice", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities, also necessary for space
navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides.
As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking.
The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion.

employ the ‘Thought Police’ to persecute individuality and independent thinking.  Big Brother, the dictatorial
leader of Oceania, enjoys an intense cult of personality, manufactured by the party's excessive brainwashing
techniques. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker. He enters into a
forbidden relationship with his colleague Julia and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came
to power.

Author:  Amie Kaufman, Jay Kristoff
About: The year is 2380, and the graduating cadets of Aurora Academy are being assigned their first missions.
Star pupil Tyler Jones is ready to recruit the squad of his dreams, but his own boneheaded heroism sees him
stuck with the dregs nobody else in the academy would touch and Ty’s squad isn’t even his biggest problem—
that’d be Aurora Jie-Lin O’Malley, the girl he’s just rescued from interdimensional space. Trapped in
cryo-sleep for two centuries, Auri is a girl out of time and out of her depth. But she could be the catalyst that
starts a war millions of years in the making, and Tyler’s squad of losers, discipline cases, and misfits might
just be the last hope for the entire galaxy. NOBODY PANIC

4.	Darwin’s  Radio
Author:  Greg Bear
About:  Mitch, a young American archaeologist in disrepute, discovers in the Alps the frozen and mummified
corpses of a Neanderthal family that died under mysterious circumstances. Kaye, a microbiologist , is called
away to examine a mass grave where pregnant women have evidently been shot. Christopher Dicken of the
Centers for Disease Control has been monitoring similar incidents around the world for several years and runs
into Kaye there. These three lives intersect as an apparent retrovirus seems to be killing fetuses by the
thousands all over the world; common people riot, and governments prepare for martial law and the
segregation not only of men from women because the virus seems to be transmitted sexually. But then the
women who have aborted spontaneously become pregnant AGAIN without sexual contact, and Mitch, Kaye,
and Christopher begin to suspect something very different from a mere epidemic is happening.
Bear masterfully mixes considerable biological science and theory, and a little archaeology into a gripping tale.

her help: Castor, a childhood friend of Lore believed long dead, and a gravely wounded Athena, among the
last of the original gods.The goddess offers an alliance against their mutual enemy and, at last, a way for Lore
to leave the Agon behind forever. But Lore's decision to bind her fate to Athena's and rejoin the hunt will
come at a deadly cost--and still may not be enough to stop the rise of a new god with the power to bring
humanity to its knees.
